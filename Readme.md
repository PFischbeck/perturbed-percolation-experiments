These are the experiments for the SIROCCO 2022 paper ["Accelerated Information Dissemination on Networks with Local and Global Edges"](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-09993-9_5).

# Installation

- Make sure you have Python, Pip and R installed.
- Checkout this repository

- Install the python dependencies with

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Install the `pygirgs` package at https://github.com/PFischbeck/pygirgs

- Install the R dependencies (used for plots) with

```
R -e 'install.packages(c("ggplot2", "reshape2", "plyr", "dplyr", "scales"), repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
```

# File structure

- The folder `inputs` contains all networks used, taken from networkrepository.com.
- `runner.py` is used for executing the Python experiments.
- The folder `outputs` contains all data generated by the experiments.
- The folder `R` contains R scripts for generating the plots.
- The folder `plots` contains all plots generated by the R scripts.

# Executing the experiments

- Execute `python3 runner.py --experiment <experiment_name>`
- The different experiments are as follows:

  - `graph_sizes`: Print the real-world graph sizes
  - `rw_bootstrap`: Run bootstrap percolation for all real-world local graphs
  - `rw_perturbed`: Run perturbed percolation for all combinations of real-world local+global graphs
  - `rw_perturbed_different_r`: Run perturbed percolation for a fixed real-world combination for different r values
  - `different_r`: Run perturbed percolation on torus local + Erdos-Renyi global graph, for different r values
  - `different_r_girg`: Run perturbed percolation on torus local + GIRG global graph, for different r values
  - `different_r_cl`: Run perturbed percolation on torus local + Chung-Lu global graph, for different r values
  - `girg_different_beta`: Run perturbed percolation on torus local + GIRG global graph, for different beta values
  - `girg_different_t`: Run perturbed percolation on torus local + GIRG global graph, for different t values
  - `cl_different_beta`: Run perturbed percolation on torus local + Chung-Lu global graph, for different beta values
